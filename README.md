# Snake-Game-Application
The Snake Game is a classic single-player game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the borders of the game board or the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases..
